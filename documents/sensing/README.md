A micro-mouse is a battery powered robot whose goal is to navigate through a maze. The documentation is
for the sensing subsystem within the context of the UCT EEE3088F Micro-mouse project. The
project focuses on the design of the micro-mouseâ€™s hardware. The sensing subsystem is one of four
subsystems in this project, namely: the motherboard, the processor, power and sensing.
