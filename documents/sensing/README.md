This folder contains documentation for the sensing subsystem within the context of the UCT EEE3088F Micro-mouse project. The sensing subsystem is one of four subsystems in this project, namely: the motherboard, the processor, power and sensing.

The documentation is for the design and development of the sensing PCB responsible for detecting obstructions(walls) nearby and providing the processor with that data.
